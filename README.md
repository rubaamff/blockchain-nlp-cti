### 📘 Overview

This repository implements a **hybrid Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** framework that integrates:
- **Natural Language Processing (BERT + spaCy)** for IOC extraction  
- **Machine Learning** for adaptive classification  
- **Blockchain-inspired immutable ledger** for tamper-proof intelligence sharing  

The system achieves **95% accuracy**, **95.7% F1-score**, and **55% latency reduction** (120 ms → 54 ms for 200 reports).  
It is validated on **CIC-IDS2017** and **UNSW-NB15** datasets, with a **Cross-Dataset Robustness Index (CRI)** of 0.999.

### 🧩 Key Components
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| NLP (BERT + spaCy) | Extracts IOCs such as IPs, domains, malware names |
| ML Classifier | Confidence-weighted ensemble (Naïve Bayes, LSTM, BERT) |
| Blockchain Ledger | SHA-256 immutable chain for verified CTI logging |
| Adaptive Learning | Continuously retrains models with new threat data |
| Similarity Detector | Uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity for report clustering |
